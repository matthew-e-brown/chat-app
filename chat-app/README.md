# Client-Server Chat Application

Rather than calling this folder `assignment1`, `assignment2`, or something of
the sort, this folder is just called `chat-app`. This is because the same projet
is used for all of the assignments of COIS-4310.

This repository will have tagged commits for the points `chat-app` was in when
each Assignment was handed in.


## Assignment 1

The first assignment was to implement the basic app and get it up and running.
The thoery part of the assignment was to implement an official(-ish) RFC
document to explain how the program works.
